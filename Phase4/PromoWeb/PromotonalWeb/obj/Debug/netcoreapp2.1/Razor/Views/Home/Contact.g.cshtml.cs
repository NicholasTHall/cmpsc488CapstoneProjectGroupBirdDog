If the barcode is for a new product, the user will additionally need to enter information describing the product. <b>Users are encouraged to enter detailed and correct information, as it will be displayed to customers and utilized in future searches.</b> Tapping the pick up button will update the inventory and reopen the camera.
        When the user is finished, they may logout by tapping the icon on the top right of the main screens.

        The user can check off orders successfully delivered and tap the next stop button to proceed. Any checked orders will be marked as complete and unchecked orders will be deferred.
