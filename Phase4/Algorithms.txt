///// ﻿Routing Algorithm (Adjusted k-Means) /////


Plot all order addresses and group into clusters equal to # of available trucks
        Clusters will attempt to have equal heuristic of workload = # stop X product volume


For each stop not grouped w/in some distance TBD of the closest cluster, recalculate the workload of the cluster if it were to include that stop.
	If the workload is still acceptable or the priority is high enough that it must be included, include the stop in that cluster and continue.
	If the workload is now above an acceptable level, try to include the stop with the next nearest cluster with the TBD distance.
	If a stop cannot be included in the cluster, exclude it from today’s routes and increase its priority.


Calculate a route for each cluster using Google Maps or something similar.


///// Palletization Algorithm /////


From our routing algorithm, we will have the following guarantees:
	Orders will not be split between routes.
	The truck for each route will be able to fit the all the orders along the route.
Additionally, each order has a list of products and their quantity, that each specify a priority and volume.


Sort orders according to their reverse sequence of delivery on the route (with last stops first).
Select first pallet and first order.
	If the order has a volume greater than the max volume of a pallet, repeatedly select and mark the next pallet to contain order until a pallet is left with space and continue.
	If the order has a volume greater than the current space, mark the next pallet.
	If the order has a volume less than the current space, mark the current pallet.
Repeat until all orders have been assigned to a pallet.
	If number of pallets exceeds number of allowed pallets on truck, combine pallets until pallets can no longer be combined.
	If number of pallets still exceeds number of allowed pallets, reset markings and repeat while allowing all orders to be split across pallets instead of just those larger than a pallet.

For each pallet, sort the individual products according their priority (with sturdier products first).
Then when a picker selects a new pallet, the products for that pallet with be sent to them in the order they should be placed on the pallet.
