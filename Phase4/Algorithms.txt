//	Routing Algorithm	//


Plot all order addresses and group into clusters equal to # of available trucks
        Clusters will attempt to have equal heuristic of workload = # stop X product volume


For each stop not grouped w/in some distance TBD of the closest cluster, recalculate the workload of the cluster if it were to include that stop.
	If the workload is still acceptable or the priority is high enough that it must be included, include the stop in that cluster and continue.
	If the workload is now above an acceptable level, try to include the stop with the next nearest cluster with the TBD distance.
	If a stop cannot be included in the cluster, exclude it from today’s routes and increase its priority.


Calculate a route for each cluster using Google Maps or something similar.
